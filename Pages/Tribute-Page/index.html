			<h2>Here is the full story:</h2>
			<p>
				Little Aryul loves pizza. One day he ate a super-pizza that gave him super powers.
				With that power he became the biggest wizard of all times, and he decided to use his power to
				help all the people and creatures of the 16 dimensions.
			</p>
			<p>
				During Dr. Aryul's visit to the planet E613, the invasion of the aliens from the GM53 
				galaxy began and Dr. Aryul came to the aid of the locals. Dr. Aryul designed the LaserX: 
				a powerful laser rifle designed to blow up spaceships and even stars. The weapon has proven 
				to be extremely effective and has even been upgraded several times.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eventually, Dr. Aryul defeated the invaders and the universe was saved.
			</p>
			<p>
				To be continue...
